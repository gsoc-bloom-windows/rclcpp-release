ros-dashing-rclcpp (0.5.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in the multi-threaded executor which could cause it to take a timer (potentially other types of wait-able items) more than once to be worked one. (#383 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/383>)
    * Specifically this could result in a timer getting called more often that it should when using the multi-threaded executor.
  * Added functions that allow you to publish serialized messages and received serialized messages in your subscription callback. (#388 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/388>)
  * Changed code to always get the Service name from ``rcl`` to ensure the remapped name is returned. (#498 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/498>)
  * Added previously missing ``set_parameters_atomically()`` method to the Service client interface. (#494 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/494>)
  * Added ability to initialize parameter values in a Node via a YAML file passed on the command line. (#488 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/488>)
  * Fixed the ROS parameter interface which got parameters that aren't set. (#493 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/493>)
  * Added ability to initialize parameter values in a node with an argument to the Node constructor. (#486 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/486>)
  * Added a ``Subscription`` tests which uses ``std::bind`` to a class member callback. (#480 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/480>)
  * Refactored the ``ParameterVariant`` class into the ``Parameter`` and ``ParameterValue`` classes. (#481 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/481>)
  * Relaxed template matching rules for ``std::bind`` and ``GNU C++ >= 7.1``. (#484 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/484>)
  * Changed to use the new ``rosgraph_msgs/Clock`` message type for the ``/clock`` topic. (#474 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/474>)
  * Fixed a flaky ROS time test due to not spinning before getting the time. (#483 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/483>)
  * Nodes now autostart the ROS parameter services which let you get, set, and list parameters in a node. (#478 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/478>)
  * Added support for arrays in Parameters. (#443 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/443>)
  * Changed how executors use ``AnyExecutable`` objects so that they are a reference instead of a shared pointer, in order to avoid memory allocation in the "common case". (#463 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/463>)
  * Added ability to pass command line arguments to the Node constructor. (#461 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/461>)
  * Added an argument to specify the number of threads a multithreaded executor should create. (#442 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/442>)
  * Changed library export order for static linking. (#446 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/446>)

    Obviously it mean RCL_SYSTEM_TIME but not RCL_ROS_TIME in some test cases
    * Signed-off-by: jwang <mailto:jing.j.wang@intel.com>
  * Added the scale operation to ``rclcpp::Duration``.
    * Signed-off-by: jwang <mailto:jing.j.wang@intel.com>
  * Changed API of the log location parameter to be ``const``. (#451 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/451>)
  * Changed how the subscriber, client, service, and timer handles are stored to resolve shutdown order issues. (#431 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/431> and #448 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/448>)
  * Updated to get the node's logger name from ``rcl``. (#433 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/433>)

  * Updaed code to use logging macros rather than ``fprintf()``. (#439 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/439>)

  * Changed executor code to clear the wait set before resizing and waiting. (#427 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/427>)
  * Fixed a potential dereference of nullptr in the topic name validation error string. (#405 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/405>)
    * Signed-off-by: Ethan Gao <mailto:ethan.gao@linux.intel.com>
  * Changed to use ``rcl_count_publishers()`` like API's rather than the lower level ``rmw_count_publishers()`` API. (#425 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/425>)
    * Signed-off-by: Sriram Raghunathan <mailto:rsriram7@visteon.com>
  * Fix potential segmentation fault due to ``get_topic_name()`` or ``rcl_service_get_service_name()`` returning nullptr and that not being checked before access in ``rclcpp``. (#426 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/426>)
